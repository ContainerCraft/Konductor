## Example Directory Layout

Below is an example of the intended directory structure. First, we present a generic `<module_name>` directory to illustrate the foundational pattern. Then, we show a more expanded, realistic scenario with multiple providers and a `core` module, reflecting a mature Konductor codebase.

### Generic Module Layout

A single provider module follows this pattern:

```
modules/
  <module_name>/
    types/          # Pydantic configuration models for this provider
    resources/      # Low-level resources (e.g., single AWS resource definitions)
    components/     # Components that combine multiple resources into a cohesive unit
    provider.py      # Provider configuration & initialization logic
    deployment.py    # High-level orchestration logic (if needed)
    __init__.py      # Lightweight module initialization
    README.md         # Module-specific documentation
```

Within `resources/`, you may further organize files by domain or service, especially in larger providers:

```
modules/
  <module_name>/
    resources/
      service_x/
        resource_a.py
        resource_b.py
      service_y/
        resource_c.py
```

And for `components/`, you might have directories representing a full stack or complex feature:

```
modules/
  <module_name>/
    components/
      feature_x/
        deployment.py      # Composes multiple resources for feature_x
        types.py           # Optional component-level config models if needed
```

### Directory Layout Example

In a more extensive Konductor setup, multiple providers (like `aws`, `kubernetes`) and the `core` module coexist alongside `common` utilities, `tests`, and `docs`.

```

In this layout:

- Each provider module (e.g., `aws`, `kubernetes`) mirrors the same internal structure: `types/`, `resources/`, `components/`, plus `provider.py`, `deployment.py`, and `README.md`.
- `core/` sets the global stage with compliance configs, metadata handling, and base classes.
- `common/` offers shared utilities and exceptions.
- `tests/` mirror the layout, making it easy to find and write tests corresponding to each module, resource, or component.
- `docs/` provide guidance, references, and troubleshooting tips.

## Introduction

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** transforms infrastructure management from manual processes into automated, version-controlled code. By applying software engineering best practices to infrastructure, teams achieve greater agility, reproducibility, and reliability.

**Pulumi + Python**: Pulumi enables defining cloud and platform resources using a general-purpose language. Python’s readability, rich ecosystem, and extensive library support make it an excellent choice. With Pulumi and Python, you can manage resources on AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more, while benefiting from native programming constructs.

**Konductor’s Approach**: Konductor provides a standardized, scalable IaC template that integrates Pulumi, Python, and a provider-agnostic core. It enforces a clear architectural pattern:

- A **provider-agnostic `core` module** that defines compliance checks, metadata handling, base classes, and foundational abstractions.
- Each provider module (like `aws/`, `kubernetes/`) organized into three key directories:
  - **`types/`**: Pydantic-based configuration models ensuring strict runtime validation.
  - **`resources/`**: Low-level, single-resource definitions representing fundamental building blocks.
  - **`components/`**: Composed structures bundling multiple resources into cohesive, reusable solutions.

This layered approach ensures new contributors and experienced engineers alike can quickly understand where code should live, how configurations are validated, and how compliance and metadata are consistently applied. As the codebase grows, adding new providers or scaling existing ones remains straightforward.

---

## Project Overview

Konductor sets a unified pattern for IaC across multiple teams and environments. Its design objectives include:

- **Provider-Agnostic Core**: The `core` directory defines global patterns, compliance configurations, and metadata management. Provider modules build on these foundations without duplicating logic.
- **Consistent Patterns**: By enforcing `types/`, `resources/`, and `components/` directories within each provider module, Konductor offers a predictable developer experience. Engineers can navigate from one provider to another effortlessly.
- **Compliance and Security Integration**: Pydantic models and core-defined compliance configs ensure production environments cannot bypass required authorization or lifecycle checks. Strict validation prevents deploying non-compliant infrastructure.
- **Configuration-Driven Deployments**: Enable or disable modules based on stack configuration. This offers flexible deployments suited to different environments (e.g., dev vs. prod) without code rewrites.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Adding new providers or extending existing ones doesn’t require structural overhauls. The directory patterns scale naturally, letting you insert new `types/`, `resources/`, or `components/` as needed.

---

## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

Konductor leverages a devcontainer configuration to streamline the onboarding process:

**Prerequisites**:
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Remote Development Extensions**: [Install Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
- **Docker Desktop or CLI**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

**Setup Steps**:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/containercraft/konductor.git
   cd konductor
   ```

2. **Open in VSCode**:
   Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and select **"Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"** to open the project in the devcontainer. VSCode will build and start a container with all necessary tools.

3. **Start Developing**:
   Inside the devcontainer, run:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   pytest
   pulumi stack ls
   ```
   These commands confirm that Pulumi, Poetry, and testing tools are correctly installed, letting you start coding immediately.

### Repository Structure

Konductor organizes code into `core/`, `modules/<provider>`, `common/`, and `tests/` directories, plus supporting documentation and configuration files at the root. The updated architecture relies on the layered approach (types/resources/components) in provider modules. For example, `modules/aws` might contain:

- `types/` for AWS configuration models.
- `resources/` for AWS-specific resources like VPC or IAM roles.
- `components/` for composite structures like an EKS cluster built from multiple resources.

This consistent layout ensures developers can quickly locate relevant files and understand how modules are structured.

---

## Directory Structure & Layout

At a high level, Konductor’s directory structure follows these guidelines:

- **`core/`**: Defines global patterns, compliance configs, metadata handling, and shared interfaces. Providers depend on `core` to ensure consistency and DRY code.

- **`modules/<provider>/`**:
  - **`types/`**: Pydantic models for that provider’s configuration, ensuring runtime validation.
  - **`resources/`**: Low-level resource definitions (e.g., one file per resource type).
  - **`components/`**: Assemblies of multiple resources into higher-level constructs.
  - `provider.py`: Sets up the provider instance(s), handling authentication or region/context selection.
  - `deployment.py`: High-level deployment logic orchestrating components and resources as needed.
  - `__init__.py`: Initializes the module; keep it lightweight.

- **`common/`**: Shared utilities, exceptions, or cross-cutting concerns not limited to a single provider.

- **`tests/`**: Mirrors the source structure, ensuring that `core/`, `modules/`, and `common/` each have corresponding test directories. This makes it easy to write targeted unit and integration tests.

This approach ensures uniformity: if you understand how the AWS module is structured, you can easily understand Kubernetes or any future provider’s layout. Adding new providers or expanding existing ones involves following the same pattern, minimizing cognitive load.

---

## Code Organization and Modularization

Konductor’s code organization principles revolve around clarity, maintainability, and scalability:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The `core` directory handles compliance, metadata, and global abstractions. Provider modules handle their own resources and components, relying on `core` for consistency.
- **Layered Abstractions**:
  - `types/` define what configuration looks like and validate it at runtime.
  - `resources/` define the fundamental building blocks of infrastructure (single-resource definitions).
  - `components/` compose these blocks into higher-level patterns, making large-scale infrastructure definitions simpler and more reusable.
- **Uniformity**: Every provider follows the same layout, ensuring developers can jump between AWS, Kubernetes, or future providers without relearning patterns.
- **Scalability**: Adding new resources or components is as simple as creating a new file in the appropriate directory. No large-scale refactoring is needed.

By adhering to these modularization patterns, Konductor remains approachable, even as it evolves and grows.

---

## Module Development

### Core Principles

When developing or extending modules, consider:

- **Provider-Agnostic Core**: Don’t re-implement global patterns. Instead, rely on `core` for compliance checks, base configuration classes, and metadata logic.
- **Strict Typing with Pydantic**: All configuration is defined via Pydantic models. This ensures immediate feedback if configuration is invalid, preventing partial or incorrect deployments.
- **DRY and Reusable**: Centralize logic either in `core/` for global patterns or in `common/` for shared utilities. Keep provider modules focused on their own domain.
- **Document and Test**: Each module should have a `README.md` and tests. Documentation explains how to configure and use the module’s resources and components; tests ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

### Module Architecture

A typical provider module (`modules/<provider>/`) includes:

- **`types/`**: Pydantic models for config validation.
- **`resources/`**: Files dedicated to single-resource definitions (e.g., `modules/aws/resources/vpc.py` for a VPC).
- **`components/`**: Combines multiple resources into a cohesive infrastructure unit (e.g., `modules/aws/components/eks/deployment.py` might build a full EKS environment using multiple resources).
- **`provider.py`**: Instantiates and configures the provider (e.g., an AWS provider with a specific region and credentials).
- **`deployment.py`**: High-level orchestration logic, if needed, that wires up components and applies configuration-driven decisions.
- **`__init__.py`**: Keeps initializations minimal. Avoid complex logic here.

### Creating New Modules or Components

1. **Set up directories**:
   If adding a new provider, create `modules/<provider>/types`, `resources`, `components`. For a new component, add a directory under `components/` and a `deployment.py` for orchestration.

2. **Define Types**:
   Start with `types/` to define Pydantic models that describe how the module is configured. This ensures that from day one, config validation is consistent.

3. **Build Resources**:
   Implement resource definitions in `resources/`. Each file should define functions or classes that provision a single resource or a small set of related resources.

4. **Assemble Components**:
   In `components/`, write `deployment.py` files that tie together multiple resources. Components make complex infrastructure units easier to reuse and reason about.

5. **Validate and Document**:
   Add tests under `tests/modules/<provider>`, ensure configuration validation passes, and write or update `README.md` files explaining usage and configuration.

### Module Testing and Documentation

- **Unit Tests**: Test resources and components in isolation, using mocks to avoid real deployments.
- **Integration Tests**: Confirm that components and their resources work together under realistic configurations.
- **Documentation**: Each module’s `README.md` should describe configuration models, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.

By following these steps, modules remain understandable, maintainable, and aligned with Konductor’s architectural principles.

---

## Entry Point and Initialization

### Simplified Entry Point (`__main__.py`)

Konductor’s `__main__.py` orchestrates the overall deployment:

1. **Initialize Pulumi**: Load stack configuration via `pulumi.Config()` and pass it into Pydantic models for validation.
2. **Setup Metadata**: Use `core` logic to apply global tags, labels, annotations, and Git commit references.
3. **Determine Enabled Modules**: Based on config, decide which provider modules to deploy.
4. **Delegate to Deployment Manager**: A `DeploymentManager` in `core/deployment.py` dynamically loads and deploys enabled modules.

This approach keeps `__main__.py` minimal, pushing complexity into well-structured `core` utilities.

### Module Initialization (`__init__.py`)

Each module’s `__init__.py` should remain lightweight. Avoid resource definitions or heavy logic here. Instead, use it to expose public APIs or initialize provider-specific settings minimally. Keeping initialization simple reduces import overhead and complexity.

---

## Configuration Management

Konductor integrates Pulumi configuration with Pydantic models to ensure robust validation:

- **Pulumi Stacks**: Define environment-specific settings, secrets, and module enablement in `Pulumi.<stack>.yaml`.
- **Pydantic Validation**: Pydantic models enforce that configs are correct in structure and content. If a field is missing or invalid, deployment fails early.
- **Secrets Management (ESC)**: Use Pulumi’s Environments, Secrets, and Configuration (ESC) to securely store and retrieve sensitive data. Pydantic ensures these secrets are also validated.

This combination guarantees that misconfigurations never proceed silently. Developers learn about issues before resources are created.

---

## Dynamic Module Loading

Konductor supports dynamic, configuration-driven deployments:

- **Configuration-Driven**: A stack configuration might enable AWS while disabling Kubernetes, or vice versa.
- **Lazy Importing**: The `DeploymentManager` in `core/deployment.py` uses Python’s `importlib` to load only enabled modules. Disabled modules are never even imported, saving time and complexity.
- **Flexible Environments**: This setup allows the same codebase to serve different environments without rewriting code. Adjust a single config value, and the stack’s shape changes accordingly.

Dynamic module loading supports efficient resource usage and simplifies experimentation and scaling.

---

## Type Safety, Static Type Checking, and Pydantic Models

Konductor enforces type safety at two levels:

1. **Runtime (Pydantic)**: Config models validate inputs at runtime, catching errors early.
2. **Static (Pyright/MyPy)**: Type hints and a static checker ensure internal consistency and catch logical errors before execution.

By combining static type checks with Pydantic runtime validation, developers enjoy both early feedback and robust runtime guarantees, improving confidence and reliability in their infrastructure code.

---

## Dependency Management with Poetry

Poetry ensures Python dependency management remains clean and consistent:

- **Single Source of Truth**: `pyproject.toml` declares all dependencies, dev tools, and scripts.
- **Reproducible Environments**: `poetry.lock` pins versions, ensuring stable and repeatable builds.
- **Pulumi Integration**: Specify Poetry as the runtime in `Pulumi.yaml`, so Pulumi commands run in the Poetry-managed virtual environment.
- **Adding Dependencies**: Use `poetry add <package>` or `poetry add --dev <package>` to manage runtime and dev dependencies. This clean separation prevents clutter and makes dependency updates predictable.

---

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

Consistent coding standards ensure everyone writes maintainable, readable code:

### Code Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Adhere to Python’s standard formatting. Tools like `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` maintain consistency automatically.
- **Docstrings**: Document modules, classes, functions, and methods. Clear docstrings help new contributors understand code more quickly.

### Consistent Naming Conventions

- **Modules and Files**: `snake_case` for filenames and directories.
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `EKSConfig`, `AWSProviderConfig`).
- **Functions and Variables**: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_enabled_modules`, `deploy_resources`).

### Error Handling and Exceptions

- **Custom Exceptions**: Define domain-specific exceptions in `common/exceptions.py` if needed.
- **Consistent Logging**: Use `pulumi.log` for logging. Avoid printing directly to stdout.
- **Fail Early**: Let Pydantic models catch config errors. If something is missing or invalid, raise an exception before provisioning resources.

### Advanced Coding Techniques

- **List Comprehensions & Generators**: Create multiple similar resources succinctly.
- **Conditional Logic Driven by Config**: Let configuration determine which resources or modules deploy, rather than scattering conditionals throughout the code.
- **Embrace Pydantic Features**: Validators, default factories, and complex field types enhance reliability and flexibility.

---

## Testing and Continuous Integration

High-quality tests and CI pipelines ensure long-term code health:

- **Test Mirrors Code Structure**: Place tests under `tests/` in a directory structure mirroring `core/` and `modules/`.
- **Unit Tests**: Test resources and components in isolation. Use mocks to avoid deploying real resources.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate that components work together under realistic configs.
- **Continuous Integration**: Run tests, linting, type checks, and security scans on every Pull Request. Fail fast if any check fails, preventing flawed code from merging.

This rigorous testing and CI approach ensures that changes remain reliable, secure, and maintainable.

---

## Collaboration and Workflow

Konductor’s patterns support a distributed team environment:

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork and Branch**: Create feature branches off `main`.
2. **Develop and Test**: Write code, add tests, ensure local checks pass.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: Include a summary of changes, link related issues, and demonstrate test coverage.
4. **Respond to Feedback**: Address reviewer comments, refine code, and ensure CI checks pass before merging.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **PR Templates**: If available, follow them. Provide context, testing instructions, and expected outcomes.
- **Include Tests**: New features or fixes should come with tests.
- **Pass All Checks**: Wait for CI to pass before requesting reviews.

### Code Review Process

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Reviewers look for clear, maintainable code that adheres to standards.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Suggestions should help improve code or share best practices.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Code reviews facilitate learning and ensure consistent patterns.

---

## Scaling Considerations

As infrastructure grows in complexity and size, Konductor’s layered architecture remains robust:

- **Lazy Loading and Config-Driven Deployments**: Enable or disable modules to tailor deployments to each environment. This prevents unnecessary resource creation and keeps complexity manageable.
- **Performance Optimization**: For very large environments, consider caching frequently used configurations or parallelizing certain tasks if supported by Pulumi and underlying providers.
- **Stateful and Modular**: Stateful Pulumi ecosystem patterns remove the need for complex state management and DRY code patterns ensure scaling out new providers or adding advanced features remains straightforward.

By following these principles, scaling Konductor to handle more providers, more services, and stricter compliance requirements doesn’t require structural overhauls—just apply the same patterns more widely.

---

## Additional Considerations

### Security

- **Least Privilege**: Apply the minimal permissions needed for each resource (IAM roles, RBAC in Kubernetes).
- **Secrets Management**: Use Pulumi ESC for secure secret handling. Pydantic ensures even secrets meet validation criteria.
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Production stacks must define authorized and EOL dates. Missing these halts deployment, preventing non-compliant resources from ever being created.

### Documentation Standards

- **README Files**: Each module and component should have a `README.md` with configuration examples, usage instructions, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Reference Docs**: Maintain reference docs in `docs/reference/`. Keep them updated as patterns evolve.
- **Continuous Updates**: Update documentation as features, compliance rules, or best practices change. Outdated docs erode trust and slow down onboarding.

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Centralized Logging**: Integrate with external logging solutions. Logs help diagnose and trace issues quickly.
- **Alerting and Observability**: Monitor deployments, set alerts for failures, and consider adding metrics or tracing for complex workflows.

---

## Available Modules

Konductor currently supports multiple providers, each following the same layered structure:

- **AWS Module**: `modules/aws/` with `types/` for AWS configs, `resources/` for AWS services (VPC, S3, IAM, etc.), and `components/` for complex deployments (EKS clusters).
- **Kubernetes Module**: `modules/kubernetes/` with types, resources (namespaces, Helm charts), and components (Flux, Pulumi Operator setups).

As the codebase grows, adding new providers (Azure, GCP, etc.) or specialized modules (e.g., databases, message queues) follows the same pattern, ensuring consistency and ease of navigation.

---

## Conclusion

By embracing a provider-agnostic core, strictly typed Pydantic models, and a uniform `types/`, `resources/`, `components/` structure, Konductor stands as a robust, scalable, and accessible IaC framework:

- **Easy Onboarding**: New contributors quickly grasp where to place code, how to validate configs, and how to write tests.
- **Maintainability**: A consistent architecture ensures minimal friction when adding new features or modifying existing ones.
- **Security and Compliance**: Integrated compliance checks and secret management ensure production stacks adhere to policies and best practices.
- **Scalability**: The codebase scales naturally, supporting multiple providers and complex topologies without architectural upheaval.

Konductor’s patterns enable teams to build and maintain complex infrastructure confidently and efficiently.
