# Konductor Core Module

The **Konductor Core Module** provides the essential, provider-agnostic foundation on which the Konductor platform’s Infrastructure as Code (IaC) template is built. By establishing standardized data models, compliance configurations, metadata handling, and modular patterns, the core module ensures that all other modules, submodules, and componentst from AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, or any other platform, conform to a unified, secure, and maintainable framework.

This README offers a high-level overview of the core module’s purpose, architectural philosophy, and integration points. For detailed type definitions and low-level technical reference, please see the [Types Documentation](./TYPES.md).

## Introduction

In complex, multi-cloud and hybrid environments, ensuring consistency, security, compliance, and clarity in IaC codebases is paramount. The Konductor Core Module addresses these challenges by providing a stable, provider-agnostic foundation that sets common patterns and ensures all other modules and components adhere to a shared standard of excellence.

## Purpose and Scope

**What It Does:**

- Defines fundamental data models—resources, configurations, compliance, etc.—serving as the lingua franca for all modules.
- Provides interfaces and protocols ensuring that every module, regardless of which provider it targets (AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, etc.), follows a standardized lifecycle and interaction pattern.
- Manages global metadata, labels, and annotations, so that resources deployed by different modules share consistent governance, compliance, and observability practices.
- Supplies compliance frameworks (FISMA, NIST) and ATO-related metadata to ensure secure and compliant deployments across all providers and stacks.

**What It Does Not Do:**

- The Core module does not implement provider-specific logic. Instead, it sets standards that provider-specific modules must follow.
- The Core module does not handle other module or submodule specific logic. Instead, it provides the building blocks and patterns as an interface for other modules to extend.

## Core Principles

1. **Provider-Agnostic**: The core module never assumes a particular cloud provider or technology. Its abstractions and data models are universal, ensuring AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, and others can be integrated without conflict.
2. **Strict Type Safety**: Using Pydantic models, typed dictionaries, and Python protocols, the core module enforces correctness and clarity at every level.
3. **Security and Compliance First**: Compliance and governance constructs (e.g., FISMA, NIST controls, ATO details) are built into the foundation.
4. **Metadata-Driven**: Resources and configurations come enriched with standardized global metadata for traceability and governance.
5. **Modularity and Reusability**: Interfaces and base classes encourage code reuse, simplifying integration across multiple cloud providers and platforms.

## Provider-Agnostic, Unified Interface

A key role of the core module is to create a standardized, common shared interface between all separate provider modules—AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, and beyond. By defining universal protocols and configuration patterns, the core module ensures that:

- Every module, regardless of provider, implements the same lifecycle hooks (e.g., `validate_config()`, `deploy()`, `post_deploy_validation()`).
- Every resource, no matter where it’s provisioned, follows the same tagging, labeling, and annotation patterns.
- Compliance and security measures are uniformly applied across all stacks and environments, eliminating guesswork and reducing complexity when mixing multiple providers.

This unified interface means teams can seamlessly integrate new providers and modules without rethinking their entire IaC strategy. The core module serves as the “common language” that all modules speak.

## Foundational Data Models and Configuration Types

The `core/types` module defines comprehensive data models:

- **`ResourceBase`**: Standardizes how resources are represented.
- **`InitializationConfig`**, **`ConfigBase`**: Establish consistent initialization and configuration patterns for stacks and modules.
- **`ModuleBase`, `ModuleRegistry`, `ModuleDeploymentResult`**: Enable a common approach to module registration, deployment, and result reporting.
- **Git and Compliance Types**: Integrate Git repository metadata and compliance data into the core, ensuring uniform traceability.

## Compliance and Security

Compliance frameworks (ATO, FISMA, NIST) integrate natively at the core level:

- **Mandatory ATO Info for Production**: Prevents accidental non-compliant deployments.
- **NIST/FISMA Controls**: Allows auditing tools and policies to rely on a single, consistent compliance data source.

This ensures that compliance is not an afterthought but a built-in characteristic of every resource and module.

## Metadata Management

The `MetadataSingleton` and related patterns guarantee:

- **Global Consistency**: Unified tags, labels, and annotations across all providers and modules.
- **Traceability and Governance**: Git commit hashes, stack names, and project identifiers are globally applied, aiding auditing and cost allocation.
- **Platform-Wide Observability**: Metadata standards help teams monitor, troubleshoot, and manage resources uniformly.

## Module Integration and Interfaces

**Protocols like `ModuleInterface` and `DeploymentContext`** define how modules interact with the core system:

- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Every module, regardless of the provider it targets, must validate configs, run pre-deploy checks, deploy resources, and validate results in a uniform way.
- **Dependency Handling**: Modules declare their dependencies, ensuring proper deployment order without ad-hoc logic.

This interface-driven approach streamlines maintenance, testing, and scalability as teams add new providers or services.

## Configuration Management

The `ConfigManager` and base configuration types ensure:

- **Unified Config Access**: All modules, from AWS to Kubernetes, retrieve configuration uniformly.
- **Validation-First Approach**: Pydantic models prevent invalid configs from ever reaching runtime.
- **Dynamic and Modular**: Configurations can be layered and overridden, allowing easy adaptation to different environments or providers.

## Extensibility and Modularity

By focusing on provider-agnostic abstractions:

- **Easy Integration of New Providers**: Implementing a new cloud provider module only requires adhering to the core interfaces and data models.
- **Custom Compliance or Metadata Policies**: Add them once in the core, and they apply platform-wide.
- **Future-Proofing**: As new technologies emerge, integrating them is easier because the core sets stable, universal standards.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Start from the Core**: Understand `ResourceBase`, `InitializationConfig`, and `ComplianceConfig` before implementing provider modules.
- **Embrace Global Metadata**: Rely on the metadata patterns and global compliance rules set by the core to ensure consistency.
- **Validate Early**: Use the provided validations to avoid runtime failures, ensuring stable, predictable deployments.
- **Follow the Interfaces**: Every module should implement `ModuleInterface` so that it integrates seamlessly with others and shares common lifecycle patterns.

## Conclusion

The Konductor Core Module sets the stage for a stable, secure, and maintainable multi-provider IaC ecosystem. By providing a provider-agnostic interface, strict type safety, built-in compliance and metadata management, it ensures every module—whether it targets AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, or another platform—coheres to the same high standards.

This foundational, universal interface simplifies adoption of new technologies, improves cross-team collaboration, and ensures that the Konductor platform remains adaptable and future-ready as the infrastructure landscape evolves.
