# Testing Infrastructure Code with Konductor

## Introduction: The Journey to Reliable Infrastructure

Infrastructure testing often starts with a simple question: "How do we know our infrastructure changes will work?" For platform engineers, this question becomes increasingly complex as infrastructure scales and teams grow. Konductor, built on Pulumi and Python, brings the robust testing practices we've come to expect in application development to infrastructure code.

Let's explore how Konductor enables comprehensive infrastructure testing, starting from unit tests and building up to full stack validation. This guide distills years of platform engineering experience into practical testing patterns that help teams build reliable, secure, and maintainable infrastructure.

## Why Test Infrastructure?

Consider these common scenarios:
- A routine infrastructure update takes down production services
- Security groups accidentally expose sensitive ports
- Configuration drift causes mysterious failures
- Teams lose confidence in making infrastructure changes

Testing infrastructure isn't just about catching errors - it's about building confidence in your platform. With Konductor, we can catch issues early and ensure our infrastructure meets organizational standards:

```python
# Example: Catching security issues early
def test_security_group_rules():
    """Ensure security groups don't expose sensitive ports."""
    config = SecurityGroupConfig(
        name="web-tier",
        ingress_rules=[
            {
                "protocol": "tcp",
                "from_port": 80,
                "to_port": 80,
                "cidr_blocks": ["0.0.0.0/0"]
            }
        ]
    )

    # This would fail if SSH (port 22) was exposed
    validate_security_rules(config)
```

## Setting Up for Success

Konductor's testing framework integrates seamlessly with pytest, enabling both unit and integration tests. Let's set up a proper testing environment:

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from modules.core.types import InitializationConfig, GitInfo
from pulumi import automation as auto

@pytest.fixture
def mock_init_config():
    """Provide a mocked InitializationConfig for testing."""
    return InitializationConfig(
        pulumi_config={},
        stack_name="test",
        project_name="konductor-test",
        default_versions={},
        git_info=GitInfo(
            commit_hash="test-hash",
            branch_name="test-branch",
            remote_url="test-url"
        ),
        metadata={"labels": {}, "annotations": {}}
    )

@pytest.fixture
def pulumi_mocks():
    """Configure Pulumi resource mocks."""
    from pulumi.runtime import set_mocks

    def mock_resource(args: auto.MockResourceArgs):
        return [args.name + '_id', args.inputs]

    def mock_call(args: auto.MockCallArgs):
        return args.inputs

    set_mocks(auto.MockResourceMonitor(
        new_resource_fn=mock_resource,
        call_fn=mock_call
    ))
```

## Writing Effective Unit Tests

Unit testing infrastructure code might seem counterintuitive at first - after all, infrastructure is all about real-world resources. However, Konductor's type-safe approach enables robust testing of configuration, validation, and resource properties before deployment:

```python
# tests/aws/test_vpc.py
import pytest
from modules.aws.vpc import create_vpc
from modules.core.types import VpcConfig

def test_vpc_configuration():
    """Test VPC configuration validation."""
    # Valid configuration
    config = VpcConfig(
        name="prod-vpc",
        cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16",
        subnets=[
            {"az": "us-west-2a", "cidr": "10.0.1.0/24"},
            {"az": "us-west-2b", "cidr": "10.0.2.0/24"}
        ]
    )

    # Should validate successfully
    assert config.validate()

    # Invalid CIDR
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        VpcConfig(
            name="invalid-vpc",
            cidr_block="invalid-cidr"
        )

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_vpc_creation(pulumi_mocks, mock_init_config):
    """Test VPC resource creation and tagging."""
    vpc = create_vpc(
        VpcConfig(
            name="test-vpc",
            cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16"
        ),
        mock_init_config
    )

    assert vpc.cidr_block == "10.0.0.0/16"
    assert vpc.tags["managed-by"] == "konductor"
```

## Resource Property Testing

One of Konductor's strengths is enforcing organizational standards through property testing. This ensures infrastructure meets security, compliance, and architectural requirements:

```python
# tests/property/test_security.py
from modules.core.testing import ResourceValidationPolicy
from typing import Dict, Any

def validate_encryption(args: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Ensure resources use encryption."""
    if args.type == "aws:s3/bucket:Bucket":
        encryption = args.props.get("serverSideEncryptionConfiguration")
        if not encryption:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Bucket {args.name} must have encryption enabled"
            )

def test_storage_encryption(pulumi_mocks):
    """Test storage encryption requirements."""
    policy = ResourceValidationPolicy(
        name="storage-encryption",
        validate=validate_encryption
    )

    # This would fail if encryption is missing
    policy.validate(bucket_config)
```

## Testing Complex Configurations

Real-world infrastructure often involves complex configurations and dependencies. Konductor's testing framework handles these scenarios elegantly:

```python
# tests/kubernetes/test_cluster.py
def test_cluster_configuration():
    """Test EKS cluster configuration and add-ons."""
    cluster_config = ClusterConfig(
        name="prod-cluster",
        version="1.27",
        addons=[
            {"name": "vpc-cni", "version": "v1.12.0"},
            {"name": "coredns", "version": "v1.9.3"},
            {"name": "kube-proxy", "version": "v1.27.1"}
        ],
        node_groups=[
            {
                "name": "system",
                "instance_type": "t3.large",
                "min_size": 2,
                "max_size": 4
            }
        ]
    )

    # Validate version compatibility
    assert validate_addon_versions(cluster_config)

    # Check node group configuration
    assert validate_node_groups(cluster_config)
```

## Beyond Unit Tests: Testing Infrastructure in the Real World

While unit tests provide a critical foundation, real infrastructure operates in complex, interconnected environments. Deployment validation, runtime testing, and automated verification become essential as infrastructure scales. Let's explore how Konductor's integration testing capabilities help teams deliver reliable infrastructure with confidence.

## Integration Testing: The Path to Production

Think of integration testing as your dress rehearsal before production. It catches issues that only emerge when components interact - like networking misconfigurations, permission boundaries, or timing issues. Konductor's integration testing framework makes this systematic:

```python
# tests/integration/test_platform.py
import pytest
from modules.core.testing import StackTest
from typing import Dict, Any

class TestPlatformDeployment(StackTest):
    """Validate complete platform deployment."""

    async def test_full_deployment(self):
        """Deploy and validate entire platform stack."""
        # Deploy test stack
        stack = await self.create_stack("platform-test")

        try:
            # Deploy infrastructure
            result = await stack.up()
            assert result.summary.result == "succeeded"

            # Verify VPC configuration
            vpc = self.find_resource(result, "aws:ec2/vpc:Vpc")
            assert vpc.private_subnets > 0, "VPC must have private subnets"

            # Verify EKS cluster
            cluster = self.find_resource(result, "aws:eks/cluster:Cluster")
            assert await self.validate_cluster_health(cluster)

            # Verify platform services
            assert await self.verify_platform_services(cluster)

        finally:
            # Cleanup
            await stack.destroy()
```

## Runtime Validation: Testing Real Infrastructure

Infrastructure isn't just about successful deployment - it needs to work in practice. Konductor enables comprehensive runtime testing:

```python
# tests/integration/validators.py
import requests
import boto3
from kubernetes import client, config
from typing import Dict, Any

class PlatformValidator:
    """Validate deployed platform components."""

    def __init__(self, cluster_info: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.cluster = cluster_info
        self._setup_clients()

    async def validate_ingress_controller(self) -> bool:
        """Verify ingress controller is operational."""
        try:
            # Check ingress controller endpoints
            response = requests.get(
                f"https://{self.cluster['ingress_endpoint']}/healthz",
                timeout=5
            )
            return response.status_code == 200
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Ingress validation failed: {str(e)}")
            return False

    async def verify_service_mesh(self) -> bool:
        """Validate service mesh configuration."""
        try:
            # Check Istio control plane
            status = await self.check_istio_status()
            if not status.healthy:
                return False

            # Verify mTLS enforcement
            return await self.validate_mtls_policy()
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Service mesh validation failed: {str(e)}")
            return False
```

## Property Testing in Production

Production environments demand rigorous compliance and security standards. Konductor's property testing framework scales to production needs:

```python
# tests/property/production_policies.py
from modules.core.testing import (
    ResourceValidationPolicy,
    ComplianceReport
)

class ProductionPolicies:
    """Production infrastructure policies."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.policies = [
            self.encryption_policy(),
            self.network_policy(),
            self.tagging_policy(),
            self.backup_policy()
        ]

    def encryption_policy(self) -> ResourceValidationPolicy:
        """Enforce encryption standards."""
        def validate(args: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
            if args.type in STORAGE_RESOURCES:
                if not is_encryption_compliant(args.props):
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"Resource {args.name} violates encryption policy"
                    )

        return ResourceValidationPolicy(
            name="encryption-standards",
            validate=validate
        )

    async def validate_environment(
        self,
        stack_name: str
    ) -> ComplianceReport:
        """Validate entire environment against policies."""
        report = ComplianceReport()

        for policy in self.policies:
            result = await policy.validate_stack(stack_name)
            report.add_result(policy.name, result)

        return report
```

## CI/CD Integration: Automated Testing Pipeline

A robust CI/CD pipeline automatically validates infrastructure changes. Here's how to integrate Konductor's testing framework:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/infrastructure.yml
name: Infrastructure Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'infrastructure/**'
      - 'modules/**'

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Konductor
        uses: containercraft/konductor-action@v1

      - name: Run Test Suite
        run: |
          # Unit tests
          poetry run pytest tests/unit/

          # Property tests
          poetry run pytest tests/property/

          # Integration tests (if on main branch)
          if [[ ${{ github.ref }} == 'refs/heads/main' ]]; then
            poetry run pytest tests/integration/
          fi

      - name: Generate Test Report
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const report = require('./test-report.json')
            const summary = generateTestSummary(report)
            await github.rest.issues.createComment({
              ...context.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              body: summary
            })
```

## Advanced Testing Patterns

As infrastructure grows, advanced testing patterns become essential. Here's how Konductor handles complex scenarios:

```python
# tests/advanced/test_disaster_recovery.py
class TestDisasterRecovery:
    """Validate disaster recovery capabilities."""

    async def test_region_failover(self):
        """Test cross-region failover."""
        primary = await self.deploy_stack("primary", "us-west-2")
        secondary = await self.deploy_stack("secondary", "us-east-1")

        try:
            # Simulate primary region failure
            await self.simulate_region_failure(primary)

            # Verify automatic failover
            assert await self.verify_failover(primary, secondary)

            # Validate data consistency
            assert await self.verify_data_replication(primary, secondary)

        finally:
            await self.cleanup_stacks([primary, secondary])

    async def test_backup_restoration(self):
        """Validate backup and restore procedures."""
        stack = await self.create_test_stack()

        try:
            # Create test data
            test_data = await self.generate_test_data()
            await self.populate_stack(stack, test_data)

            # Trigger backup
            backup = await stack.create_backup()

            # Destroy and recreate from backup
            await stack.destroy()
            new_stack = await self.restore_from_backup(backup)

            # Verify data integrity
            assert await self.verify_data_integrity(
                new_stack,
                test_data
            )

        finally:
            await self.cleanup_resources()
```

## Production Best Practices

After implementing hundreds of infrastructure deployments, certain testing patterns have proven invaluable:

1. **Automated Compliance Checking**:
   ```python
   # Continuous compliance monitoring
   @scheduled_task(cron="0 */6 * * *")  # Every 6 hours
   async def audit_infrastructure():
      report = await ProductionPolicies().validate_environment("prod")
      if not report.compliant:
          await notify_security_team(report)
   ```

2. **Drift Detection**:
   ```python
   # Regular drift detection
   async def check_infrastructure_drift():
       """Detect and report infrastructure drift."""
       drift = await stack.detect_drift()
       if drift.resources:
           await create_remediation_plan(drift)
   ```

3. **Performance Testing**:
   ```python
   async def validate_scaling():
       """Verify auto-scaling capabilities."""
       # Generate load
       await generate_test_load(duration="30m")

       # Monitor scaling behavior
       metrics = await collect_scaling_metrics()
       assert validate_scaling_performance(metrics)
   ```

## Conclusion: Building Confidence Through Testing

Comprehensive testing transforms infrastructure deployments from anxiety-inducing events into confident, routine operations. Konductor's testing framework provides the tools needed to:

- Catch issues before they reach production
- Maintain compliance and security standards
- Automate validation and verification
- Build team confidence in infrastructure changes

Remember, effective infrastructure testing is an iterative process. Start with basic unit tests, gradually add integration tests, and build up to comprehensive production validation. The investment in testing pays dividends in reliability, security, and team productivity.
