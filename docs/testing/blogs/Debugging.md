## Introduction

Debugging infrastructure-as-code differs from traditional application debugging. When working with Pulumi programs through Konductor, you're defining infrastructure using Python, but the execution happens through Pulumi's engine. This guide will help you effectively use debugging tools to troubleshoot your infrastructure definitions.

> **Note for Konductor Users**: The devcontainer includes all necessary debugging tools and extensions. No additional installation is required.

## Getting Started with Debugging

### Understanding the Debug Process

Unlike traditional Python applications, you can't directly launch your infrastructure code with F5. Instead, the process works as follows:

1. Pulumi CLI launches your program via the Python runtime
2. Your IDE attaches to this process for debugging
3. The Pulumi engine orchestrates the actual infrastructure operations

This architecture means debugging requires proper configuration of both your IDE and the Pulumi process.

### Setting Up VSCode for Debugging

The Konductor devcontainer comes with the Pulumi VSCode extension preinstalled. When you open your project in the devcontainer, you'll have immediate access to:

- Debug configurations for Pulumi programs
- Stack management interface
- Resource visualization
- Debug console integration

### Starting Your First Debug Session

1. **Open Your Infrastructure Code**
   - Navigate to your module's deployment file
   - Set breakpoints where you want to inspect variables or pause execution

2. **Access Debug Configuration**
   - Click the "Run and Debug" icon in the Activity Bar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+D`)
   - Look for "Show all automatic debug configurations"
   - Select "Pulumi..." followed by either:
     - `pulumi preview` for testing without deployment
     - `pulumi up` for full deployment debugging

3. **Select Your Stack**
   If you haven't already selected a stack, VSCode will prompt you to either:
   - Choose an existing stack
   - Create a new stack for testing

### Debug Console and Output

The Debug Console provides crucial information during your debugging session:

- Pulumi CLI output
- Resource creation/modification status
- Error messages and stack traces
- Variable inspection results

You can access this through:
- View â†’ Debug Console
- Or the Debug Console tab in the lower panel

### Basic Debugging Operations

When your breakpoint is hit, you can:

- Step through code line by line
- Inspect variable values
- View the stack trace
- Evaluate expressions
- Monitor resource states

These operations help you understand:
- How your configuration values are processed
- When and how resources are created
- What data is being passed to Pulumi
- How dependencies are resolved

## Understanding Debug Configurations

While automatic configurations work for basic scenarios, understanding the configuration options helps with more complex debugging needs:

```json
{
    "name": "Pulumi Debug",
    "type": "pulumi",
    "request": "launch",
    "command": "preview",  // or "up"
    "stackName": "dev",    // optional
    "workDir": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "env": {
        "PULUMI_DEBUG": "true"
    }
}
```

Key configuration fields:
- `command`: The Pulumi command to execute
- `stackName`: Target stack (will prompt if omitted)
- `workDir`: Working directory for the command
- `env`: Environment variables for the debug session

## Running Different Debug Modes

### Preview vs. Update Debugging

Understanding when to use each debug mode is crucial:

- **Preview Mode** (`pulumi preview`)
  - Safer for initial debugging
  - Shows planned changes without making them
  - Useful for configuration validation
  - Runs program once

- **Update Mode** (`pulumi up`)
  - Runs your program twice (preview then update)
  - Actually creates/modifies resources
  - Use `--skip-preview` to debug only the update phase
  - Essential for validating resource creation

> **Note**: Your program will hit breakpoints twice during `pulumi up` unless you use the `--skip-preview` flag.

### Running Without Debugging

Sometimes you need to run without the debugger attached. You can:

- Select "Run Without Debugging" from the Run menu
- Add `"noDebug": true` to your launch configuration
- Use the CLI directly in the integrated terminal

## Debug Console Usage

The Debug Console is your window into the Pulumi execution process:

### Viewing Output
- Infrastructure operation logs
- Resource state changes
- Error messages and warnings
- Pulumi engine messages

### Interactive Debugging
- Evaluate expressions during breakpoints
- Check variable values
- Test configuration settings
- Inspect resource properties

## Using Breakpoints Effectively

### Strategic Breakpoint Placement

Place breakpoints at critical points:
- Before resource creation
- During configuration processing
- Where dynamic values are computed
- Error handling sections

### Conditional Breakpoints

VSCode allows setting conditions for breakpoints:
- Break only if a condition is true
- Break when a value changes
- Break after a certain hit count

This is particularly useful when debugging:
- Specific resource types
- Certain configuration values
- Error conditions

## Debug Session Control

### Attach/Detach Behavior

When using `--attach-debugger`:
1. Pulumi pauses execution
2. Waits for debugger connection
3. Continues once attached
4. Maintains connection until completion

### Session Management

During active debugging:
- Use the debug toolbar for control
- Step through code execution
- Jump to specific points
- Restart the debug session if needed

## Alternative Debug Methods

If not using VSCode, you can still debug using:

```bash
pulumi up --attach-debugger
# or
pulumi preview --attach-debugger
```

Then attach your preferred debugger to the Python process.

## Debug Process Flow

A typical debug session follows this pattern:

1. **Initialization**
   - Open infrastructure code
   - Set breakpoints
   - Select debug configuration

2. **Execution**
   - Program starts
   - Debugger attaches
   - Breakpoints hit
   - Step through code

3. **Inspection**
   - Check variables
   - Verify resource properties
   - Validate configurations
   - Test conditions

4. **Completion**
   - Resources created/updated
   - Final state verification
   - Debug session ends

## Working with Launch Configurations

### Automatic vs. Custom Configurations

VSCode's Pulumi extension provides two approaches:

1. **Automatic Configurations**
   - Quick start for common scenarios
   - Generated based on project structure
   - Accessible through "Show all automatic debug configurations"
   - Ideal for standard debugging tasks

2. **Custom Launch Configurations**
   - Created in `launch.json`
   - More control over debug behavior
   - Supports environment variables
   - Enables complex debugging scenarios

### Creating Custom Configurations

Access through either:
- Click the gear icon in automatic configuration
- Manually create/edit `launch.json`

Common configuration templates:
```json
{
    "name": "Preview Infrastructure",
    "type": "pulumi",
    "request": "launch",
    "command": "preview"
}
```

```json
{
    "name": "Deploy with Debug",
    "type": "pulumi",
    "request": "launch",
    "command": "up",
    "stackName": "dev",
    "workDir": "${workspaceFolder}/infrastructure"
}
```
