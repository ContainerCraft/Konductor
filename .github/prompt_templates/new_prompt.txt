I'm working on a Pulumi codebase which is multi hybrid cloud platform engineering focused.

This is an ambitious project and there is quite a bit of nuance across the codebase due to the fact that pulumi state based infrastructure as code paradigms are a bit unique compared to normal python development.

When you're ready I'll show you the code we're going to work on next. Let me know when you've familiarized yourself with this project.

Before I show you the code we need to enhance, let me first get you familiarized with the fundamentals.
