# Konductor: Cloud-Agnostic Infrastructure Made Simple

## Overview

Welcome to **Konductor**, an open-source platform engineering framework designed to simplify and accelerate the deployment of cloud infrastructure across multiple providers. Konductor empowers teams to build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications with confidence, ensuring compliance, security, and scalability from the ground up.

Konductor leverages modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using Pulumi and Python, providing a type-safe, modular, and maintainable codebase. It abstracts the complexities of cloud environments, enabling you to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.

## Getting Started

Konductor provides a robust starting point for building cloud infrastructure. Follow the steps below to set up your development environment and start deploying with Konductor.

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: Version control system ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **Docker**: Containerization platform ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Code editor ([Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
  - **Remote Development Extension Pack**: [Install Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

### Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the Konductor Repository**

   Navigate to the [Konductor GitHub repository](https://github.com/konductor/konductor) and click the "Fork" button to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/konductor.git
   cd konductor
   ```

### Set Up the Development Environment

Konductor uses a DevContainer configuration to provide a consistent development environment.

1. **Open the Project in VSCode**

   Launch VSCode and open the `konductor` directory.

2. **Reopen in Container**

   - When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** to start the DevContainer.
   - If not prompted, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and select **"Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"**.

3. **Wait for the Container to Build**

   VSCode will build the DevContainer image and set up the environment. This may take a few minutes on the first run.


### Configure Pulumi

1. **Set Up Pulumi Configuration**

   Ensure that `Pulumi.yaml` configuration is updated with your desired configuration:

   ```yaml
   name: konductor
   runtime:
     name: python
     options:
       virtualenv: poetry
   ```
### Install Dependencies

1. **Install Pulumi Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pulumi install
   ```

2. **Log In to Pulumi**

   ```bash
   pulumi login
   ```

3. **Create a New Stack**

   ```bash
   pulumi stack init dev
   ```

   Replace `dev` with your desired stack name.

### Verify Type Checking

Konductor enforces strict type checking using Pyright.

1. **Install Pyright**

   ```bash
   poetry add --dev pyright
   ```

2. **Run Type Checking**

   ```bash
   poetry run pyright
   ```

### Deploy Your Infrastructure

1. **Preview the Deployment**

   ```bash
   pulumi preview
   ```

2. **Deploy with Pulumi**

   ```bash
   pulumi up
   ```

3. **Destroy Resources**

   When you're done, you can clean up resources:

   ```bash
   pulumi destroy
   ```
