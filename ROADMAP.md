## Introduction

This roadmap outlines the development of a next-generation, cloud-agnostic platform engineering environment.
The goal is to establish a robust, scalable, and secure multi-cloud infrastructure that automates provisioning, enforces compliance, and centralizes operational data.
This environment will empower application teams to operate safely within their own isolated accounts, supported by a streamlined, code-driven landing zone setup.

The architecture consists of a hierarchical organization with multiple organizational units (OUs) and accounts across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
Infrastructure provisioning and configuration are fully automated using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.
Compliance controls are embedded within the configuration code, ensuring consistent policy enforcement.
Centralized governance is achieved through policy propagation and centralized services for logging, monitoring, and cost management.

---

## Objectives

- **Cloud-Agnostic Design**: Support AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to prevent vendor lock-in.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Utilize code to automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management.
- **Compliance Integration**: Embed compliance controls (e.g., FISMA, NIST) within configurations to ensure consistent enforcement.
- **Automation and GitOps**: Implement full automation with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, adopting GitOps practices.
- **Centralized Governance**: Maintain centralized policies, secrets, and configurations for consistent management across all environments.
- **Scalability and Modularity**: Design for horizontal scalability and modularity to accommodate growth and technological changes.


## Key Components

### Account Structure

#### Organizational Hierarchy

- **Root Organization**: The top-level entity for each cloud provider.
  - **Security OU**:
    - **Log Archive Account**: Central repository for logs.
    - **Security Tools Account**: Hosts security tools and services.
  - **Infrastructure OU**:
    - **Networking Account**: Manages shared networking resources.
    - **Shared Services Account**: Houses services shared across the organization.
  - **Applications OU**:
    - **Development Accounts**: Environments for development teams.
    - **Testing Accounts**: Isolated testing environments.
    - **Production Accounts**: Live environments for production workloads.

#### Account Provisioning

- **Automated Provisioning**: Use IaC to programmatically create and manage organizations, OUs, and accounts across multiple cloud providers.
- **Standardized Configuration**: Ensure all accounts adhere to baseline security and configuration standards.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **Centralized IAM**: Implement a unified IAM strategy across all cloud providers.
- **Roles and Policies**:
  - Define IAM roles with the principle of least privilege.
  - Manage IAM policies and role assignments programmatically.
- **User and Group Management**:
  - Integrate with centralized identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, Okta).
  - Group users by function and assign appropriate permissions.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Tooling**: Utilize a programming language (e.g., Python) with an IaC framework that supports multi-cloud provisioning.
- **Repository Structure**:
  - **Modular Design**: Create reusable modules for common infrastructure components.
  - **Environment Separation**: Maintain separate configurations for development, testing, and production environments.
- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Automate deployment pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
  - Implement GitOps practices to ensure that Git is the single source of truth.

### Compliance and Governance

- **Policy as Code**:
  - Define compliance controls within the IaC configurations.
  - Embed policies for standards like FISMA and NIST directly into code.
- **Automated Enforcement**:
  - Use tagging and labeling to propagate compliance metadata to all resources.
  - Implement automated checks during deployment to enforce compliance.
- **Auditability**:
  - Maintain detailed logs of infrastructure changes.
  - Utilize version control history for audit trails.

### Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

- **Centralized Logging**:
  - Aggregate logs from all resources into centralized logging services.
  - Ensure logs are stored securely and comply with data retention policies.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Deploy monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect metrics.
- **Alerting Mechanisms**:
  - Configure alerts for performance issues, security incidents, and compliance violations.
  - Integrate with incident management systems for timely response.

### Networking

- **Standardized Network Topology**:
  - Define network architectures using IaC for consistency.
  - Include components like virtual networks, subnets, and routing configurations.
- **Security Controls**:
  - Manage security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), and firewall rules programmatically.
- **Cross-Cloud Connectivity**:
  - Implement VPNs or cloud interconnects for secure communication between different cloud environments.

### Cost Management

- **Cost Monitoring**:
  - Implement tools to aggregate and analyze cost data across all cloud providers.
- **Tagging for Cost Allocation**:
  - Enforce tagging standards to facilitate cost tracking by project, environment, and department.
- **Budgeting and Alerts**:
  - Set up cost thresholds and receive alerts to prevent budget overruns.

---

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Design reusable and interchangeable components to simplify maintenance and scaling.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the architecture can accommodate growth in users, data, and services without compromising performance.
- **Security by Design**: Incorporate security measures at every layer, following best practices and compliance requirements.
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks to reduce errors and increase efficiency.
- **Observability**: Build systems that are easy to monitor and debug, with comprehensive logging and metrics.
- **Immutability**: Treat infrastructure components as immutable; changes result in new deployments rather than modifications.
